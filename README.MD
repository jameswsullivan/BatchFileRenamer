- This project is written in C# as a Windows Forms App.
- File naming rules: "Only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, dot (" . "), dash (" - "), underscore (" _ "), parenthesis ( ( , ) ), and square brackets ( [ , ] ) are allowed. Pound ( # ) is used for specifying the numbering pattern. e.g.: My_New-File.name-01-###. Maximum file name length is 64 characters."


## To-Dos in future updates

- Implement the maximum file name length checker.
- Implement INFO and ERROR logging.
- Add icon to MainForm.
